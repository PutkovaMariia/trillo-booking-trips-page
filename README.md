# Trillo Landing Page

> A responsive, Flexbox-powered hotel booking landing page built with modern CSS techniques and Sass.

---

## Description

Trillo is a static landing page for a fictitious hotel booking company. Created as part of an advanced CSS & Sass course, it showcases:

- **Flexbox Layouts** for one-dimensional, flexible alignment of elements.  
- **CSS Custom Properties** for centralized theming and easy overrides.  
- **SVG Sprite Icons** with `<use>` for crisp, accessible imagery.  
- **Responsive Design**.

---

## Features

- **Flexbox Layouts**  
  Build multi-column content blocks, nav menus, and card grids that flexibly resize and reorder.

- **CSS Variables**  
  Define colors, shadows, and breakpoints in `:root`; override them in media queries or component scopes.

- **Responsive Breakpoints**  
  Write base styles for desktop; add media queries only when the design needs adjustment.

- **CSS Animations & Transitions**  
  Keyframe entrance effects, hover transforms, and background gradients bring the page to life.

- **BEM Methodology**  
  Class names follow Block–Element–Modifier for a clear, scalable architecture.

- **NPM Scripts**  
  Compile Sass, autoprefix, minify CSS, and run a live-reload dev server with simple commands.

---

## Technologies

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid fallback, custom properties)  
- **Sass (SCSS)** for variables, nesting, and partials  
- **Node.js & npm** for build tooling
